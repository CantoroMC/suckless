Patches
-------
- **case-insensitive**:  
  This patch changes case-insensitive item matching to default behaviour.
  Adds an -s option to enable case-sensitive matching.
  I modify it to -i to replace the original case insensitivity and avoid
  any conflict with packages that adopt the -i flag.
  I rather use it with case sensitivity that modify installed packages to 
  make dmenu work.
- **center**:  
  This patch add a flag (-c) which centers dmenu in the middle of the screen.
- **fuzzymatch**:  
  This patch adds support for fuzzy-matching to dmenu, allowing users to
  type non-consecutive portions of the string to be matched.
  Adds the option fuzzy to config.def.h and the flag -F to dmenu which enable
  to turn fuzzy-matching off.
- **fuzzyhighlight**:  
  This patch make it so that fuzzy matches gets highlighted and is therefore
  meant to be used together with the patch fuzzymatch.
- **numbers**:  
  Adds text which displays the number of matched and total items in the top
  right corner of dmenu.
- **password**:  
  This patch add a flag (-P) which make dmenu not directly display the keyboard
  input, but instead replace it with dots. All data from stdin will be ignored.
- **embeddedAlpha**:  
  This patch fix the error with the -w flag
- **listfullwidth**:  
  When adding a prompt to dmenu (with the -p option or in config.h) and using a 
  list arrangement, the items are indented at the prompt width.
- **xresources-alt**:  
  adds the ability to configure dmenu via Xresources.
  At startup, dmenu will read and apply the change to the applicable resource.
